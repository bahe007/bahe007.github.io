Over the past decade, Molecular Communications (MC) has emerged as a new research area in Communications. The main idea behind MC is to exploit molecules as information carriers, as is done in many natural communication processes including inter- and intracellular communication, synaptic communication, quorum sensing, and insect communication, to communicate in environments and with objects/organisms that are not suitable for conventional electromagnetic wave based communication systems. Synthetic MC systems are expected to enable new disruptive medical, environmental, and industrial applications. The objective of the proposed research training group “**Synthetic Molecular Communication Across Different Scales: From Theory to Experiments (SyMoCADS)**” is to establish the first structured doctoral training program on MC worldwide and to equip the participating doctoral students with the knowledge and skill set needed to advance this emerging interdisciplinary field of research.

To balance the inherent heterogeneity of the overall topic and the need for close interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle MC research problems, the doctoral research projects are organized in three clusters. 

Each of these clusters is setup inter-disciplinary and works on its own enclosed topic. Throughout this work, research data and software is created. Here, we will make crucial datasets and software packages open source to advance the whole molecular communication research community as a whole and accelerate our research.
