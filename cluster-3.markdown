## Cluster 3: Models, Designs, and System Architectures for Airborne MC
Airborne molecular communication (MC) is a key mechanism in nature for intra- and inter-species communication. It is relevant, e.g., for food search, mating, predator awareness, and complex social behavior. Motivated by these *natural* applications of MC, we plan to develop synthetic airborne MC systems in Cluster 3 of SyMoCADS. Thereby we plan to develop foundational technology with applications in industry and consumer devices. Furthermore, our work will unravel natural airborne MC systems.

### Software Projects
In the context of our work in C3, we will develop several software packages and make those publically available. Possible projects could include, e.g., simulation software for airborne MC systems or software for sensor fusion.

### Experimental Data
As SyMoCADS has a strong experimental component, we will also systematically collect data from our synthetic MC testbeds. Among others, we will collect data to investigate the performance of different sensing architectures and evaluate their usability for synthetic MC systems. Similar to the open source software, we will make this data publically available.  

### Opportunities for Collaboration
*Open Source* software lives from a vibrant community of collaborators. While, we primarily develop software or datasets to support our own research efforts, we make generalizable software publically available s.t. it is also useful for other research groups. In turn, we would be happy if those groups also made their contributions to this software available to advance the field as a whole.

The easiest for collaboration is to contribute to the linked Github projects once we have published the first software :)
